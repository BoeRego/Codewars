This project tackles a logic puzzle set on a 7Ã—7 grid, following strict visibility and uniqueness rules:
- Each row and column must contain skyscrapers of unique heights from 1 to 7.
- Clues are provided around the grid, indicating how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction.
- A taller skyscraper blocks the view of any shorter ones behind it.
- The puzzle has exactly one valid solution.

The reference JavaScript solution completes the task in ~10 seconds, so performance optimization is essential.
